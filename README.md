Abstract
This work introduces a Persian medical chatbot based on transformer models to fill the gap in Persian-language healthcare resources. Trained on 7,704 question–answer pairs, the system achieves 81.51% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.8151, and high BLEU scores (0.8522–0.7885). The chatbot improves access to medical knowledge for Persian speakers, particularly in underserved regions, and offers potential for lowering healthcare costs.
