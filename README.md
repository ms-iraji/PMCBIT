Abstract
The increasing need for accessible healthcare information, particularly among Persian-speaking populations, presents a significant challenge due to limited medical resources in remote areas. Despite advancements in medical chatbots, there is a notable gap in the availability of Persian-language solutions. This study addresses this gap by developing a Persian medical chatbot based on transformer models, utilizing a newly curated dataset comprising 7,704 distinct question-answer pairs. The chatbot demonstrates a high accuracy of 81.51% and achieves an F1-Score of 0.8151. Additionally, it obtains BLEU scores of 0.8522 for BLEU-1, 0.8229 for BLEU-2, 0.8118 for BLEU-3, and 0.7885 for BLEU-4. These results position the chatbot as a valuable tool for delivering medical information, enhancing accessibility, and potentially reducing healthcare costs for users in the Persian-speaking community.
